        "We all have different ways of expressing ourselves and mine is through art",
        "Hi, I'm self-trained Artist, born and raised in INDIA, I used to do cloth painting since my childhood in summer vacations, once I had been to the Art Exhibition that inspired me to keep my spirit of painting alive. Then I switched to Acrylic Painting on canvas.Painting has always been my passion.",        
        " Since my hubby works in United States , we had to move to Minnesota and as a mother of two kids it has always been a constant struggle to keep my passion alive.Now that my kids are growing up, they motivate me to work harder, and that's how I'm able to follow my dreams,I usually work from my private studio.As an Artist inspiration comes to me from my parents,My Artwork is unique I don't believe in sticking to one style or one pattern.",
